## What is this?

Bloomworld is a browser-based online game inspired by idle games and [cellular automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton).
In it, players plant various kinds of plants, each one taking up a single cell on a grid.
Every five real-world minutes, the plants reproduce, spreading to nearby cells according to rules specific to each type of plant. Each time a new cell is created, the player earns seeds!
Seeds are used to fill in new cells with different types of plants, the goal being to spread plant life as far as possible!
